# Play Services classes
This is a stripped out jar file taken from Play Services 6.1.11.
It was generated by using Play Services in an SDK app and then looking into the explored aar build folder:

    ./app/build/intermediates/exploded-aar/com.google.android.gms/play-services/6.1.11/jars/classes.jar

This is basically just the jar files, without the other resources bundled in the arr file.

It is originally intended to be used with the Aerogear Push notifications
component, but it should be fine to use it in other components.
